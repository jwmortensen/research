Extreme heat constitutes a significant threat to public health. Various studies have shown that 
extreme heat is linked to increases in mortality, emergency room visits and other diseases. Due
 to the negative effects of heat, researchers are interested in understanding the demographics 
of callers who call 911 for heat-related illnesses. One method that can be used to predict these 
demographics is a Poisson process. Poisson processes are a type of stochastic process that can be
used to model the occurrences of events in time or space. Past researchers have used them to 
describe occurrence of accidents at a given place, visits to a web site, and machine failures, 
to name just a few.  Using data collected from 1818 individuals who called 911 for a heat related 
emergency, I show how a Poisson process can be used to estimate the proportion of callers of various ages.
